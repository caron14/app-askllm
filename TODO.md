## 🚨 Current Blockers
- **Streamlit Cloud Deployment**: Full version incompatible due to 1GB RAM limit
  - Mitigation: Created lightweight demo version (app_cloud.py) ✅

## ⚠️ Risk Items
1. **Model Memory Requirements**: Qwen2.5-3B requires ~6GB VRAM minimum
   - Mitigation: Add CPU fallback and quantization options
   - Status: ⚠️ Demo version created for cloud deployment
2. **Dataset Access**: MMLU/HLE dataset may require authentication
   - Mitigation: Mock data fallback implemented ✅
3. **FAISS GPU Support**: Requires separate faiss-gpu installation
   - Mitigation: CPU index works but slower for large datasets ✅
4. **Cloud Deployment Limitations**: Streamlit Cloud has 1GB RAM limit
   - Mitigation: Created demo version with mock data ✅

## 🧪 Test Status
❌ Failing (Last checked: 2025-08-10)

## 🐛 Known Issues
1. **Streamlit UMAP tab**: May be slow with >10k points
   - Workaround: Use sampling or pre-computation
2. **Batch checkpoint frequency**: Fixed at 10 items
   - Workaround: Modify in config file
3. **Full version on Streamlit Cloud**: Incompatible due to resource limits
   - Workaround: Use demo version (app_cloud.py) or deploy locally

## 💡 Future Enhancements
- Multi-GPU support for large-scale processing
- Real-time streaming evaluation
- Integration with MLflow/Weights & Biases
- Custom embedding model training
- Active learning for judge improvement
- Real HLE dataset integration when available
- Advanced visualization techniques (t-SNE, PCA)
- Batch analysis for multiple queries
